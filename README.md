# Home Search
Simple local search engine files. Search is based on the names of the folders, files and tags, taking into account the various factors for ranking files.

## Setup
Create a database, select the desired folders, exclude unnecessary, select the desired extensions.
<br><br>
Create tags for the desired folders, if necessary.
<br><br>
By default, the access to the search is open only for the address 127.0.0.1. You can change the address list in the "Allow.txt" file. In order to open access to all addresses you must add "ALL" to the file.

## Filters
For a better search, you can apply filters.
<br>
The "ext" filter is used to search for files with a special extension.<br>Examples of queries with this filter: "Payment for electric power ext:doc+xls" or "Cat ext:jpg".<br><br>
Filter "type" - to search for files by type of data.<br>Examples of queries with this filter: "123 type:all", "Photo type:pics", "Space type:video", "NCS type:audio", "ubuntu type:arch".<br><br>
Filter "cat" - to search for files in a separate category.<br>Example of query is "Setting up gnome cat:linux," where "linux" is the name of the database to search for ("Linux.xml").<br>
By default the search is done in the standard category ("default.xml").<br>
